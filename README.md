# 1. How do I approach designing software?
# I start by breaking the software into smaller parts, each with a specific job. I make sure the design is clear and focused on what the user needs. This way, the software is easy to manage and understand.

# 2. What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
# This project taught me how to create reusable and scalable components. I also learned to design user interfaces that are engaging and handle user interactions well.

# 3. What design process did you follow for your project work?
# I used an iterative design process. I began with a simple layout and added more details step by step. Each addition was tested and refined to make sure it worked well with the rest of the project.

# 4. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
# The methods I used, like breaking down tasks, focusing on user needs, and improving in steps, can be used in any future project. These tactics help make software flexible, easy to maintain, and user-friendly.

# 5. How do I approach developing programs?
# I outline the program’s structure first, then build and test each part step by step. Writing clean, well-documented code and using version control helps keep track of changes.

# 6. What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
# I used object-oriented programming to create reusable components. Continuous testing was also crucial to catch issues early and ensure everything worked correctly.

# 7. How did iteration factor into your development?**
# Iteration was key to my development process. By refining the code and incorporating feedback regularly, I was able to improve functionality and fix issues gradually. This approach ensured a stable final product.

# 8. How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
# My approach became more structured and disciplined. Planning effectively, writing cleaner code, and integrating testing as a routine part of development helped me deliver a robust project.

# 9. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
# Computer science gives me the skills to solve problems and create innovative solutions. These abilities are essential for achieving both academic and professional goals.

# 10. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
# They teach me how to visually represent and manipulate data. This is crucial for fields like data science, game development, and user interface design, enhancing my educational journey.

# 11. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
# In a professional setting, the ability to create engaging visualizations and interactive graphics is highly valuable. These skills help in developing better software, improving user experiences, and effectively communicating complex information.
